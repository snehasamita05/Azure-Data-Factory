## Topics Covered

Here’s a summary of the core concepts I learned and implemented throughout the tutorial:

### 1. **Copy Activity**
   - Learned how to efficiently copy data between various sources and destinations within Azure Data Factory.

### 2. **For Each Activity**
   - Explored how to iterate through datasets and automate workflows to improve efficiency.

### 3. **If Condition**
   - Implemented conditional logic in data pipelines to create dynamic and responsive workflows.

### 4. **Set Variable**
   - Used the **Set Variable** activity to store crucial information within pipelines for later use.

### 5. **Triggers**
   - Set up triggers such as **schedule**, **tumbling window**, and **storage event triggers** to automate data workflows.

### 6. **Pulling Data from APIs**
   - Learned how to connect to and extract data from external APIs, expanding ADF’s capabilities.

### 7. **Real-Time Scenarios**
   - Worked on practical, real-time scenarios where Azure Data Factory plays a crucial role in the data engineering pipeline.

### 8. **Azure Data Engineer Interview Questions**
   - Explored common interview questions related to Azure Data Factory to solidify my understanding and prepare for interviews.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Copy Activity**
   - Efficiently copied data from various sources to destinations using ADF's **Copy Activity**.

### 2. **For Each Activity**
   - Automated iterative tasks with the **For Each Activity** to process multiple datasets in a loop.

### 3. **If Condition**
   - Applied conditional logic to perform actions based on pipeline states using the **If Condition** activity.

### 4. **Parameterized Pipelines**
   - Created **parameterized pipelines** to make my workflows more dynamic and reusable.

### 5. **Data Transformation Using Data Flows**
   - Implemented data transformation tasks using **Data Flows** in ADF, enabling complex ETL operations.

### 6. **Triggers and Scheduling**
   - Set up **scheduled triggers**, **tumbling window triggers**, and **storage event triggers** to automate pipeline execution.

### 7. **Debugging and Error Handling**
   - Debugged and optimized my pipelines using **debugging tools** in ADF, ensuring smooth execution.

### 8. **End-to-End Data Pipeline**
   - Built an **end-to-end data pipeline** using ADF, from data ingestion to transformation and storage.
